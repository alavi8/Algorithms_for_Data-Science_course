Exercise 2.3.4 : Selection can also be performed on bags. Give a MapReduce
implementation that produces the proper number of copies of each tuple t that
passes the selection condition. That is, produce key-value pairs from which the
correct result of the selection can be obtained easily from the values.


solution:
Map function : return (t,1) for each t.
Reduce function : take (t,[1,...,1]) and return (t,sum[1,...,1]).
