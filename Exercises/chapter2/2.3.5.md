# Exercise 2.3.5 : 
**The relational-algebra operation R(A,B) ⊲⊳ B<C S(C,D)
produces all tuples (a, b, c, d) such that tuple (a, b) is in relation R, tuple (c, d) is
in S, and b < c. Give a MapReduce implementation of this operation, assuming
R and S are sets.**


**solution :**<br>
Map function : take ((a,b),1) and ((c,d),1) and return ((b,(R,a)),1) and ((c,(S,d)),1).<br>
Reduce function : take values of Maptask and for each pair that b<c return(a,b,c,d).
