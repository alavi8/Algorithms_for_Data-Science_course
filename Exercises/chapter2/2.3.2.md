# Exercise 2.3.2 :
**Our formulation of matrix-vector multiplication assumed that
the matrix M was square. Generalize the algorithm to the case where M is an
r-by-c matrix for some number of rows r and columns c.**


**solution :**
 
assume that 
- v must have c components
- v will fit into memory

Map function : take all matrix values as input and return ( MijVj , c).<br>
Reduce function : Each key corresponds to a component of the vector v whose value is just the sum of the values associated with each key.
