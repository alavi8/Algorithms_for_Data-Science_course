    "## Suppose the Web consists of a clique (set of nodes with all possible arcs from one to another) of n nodes and a single additional node that is the successor of each of the n nodes in the clique. Figure 5.8 shows this graph for the case n = 4. Determine the PageRank of each page, as a function of n and β.\n",
